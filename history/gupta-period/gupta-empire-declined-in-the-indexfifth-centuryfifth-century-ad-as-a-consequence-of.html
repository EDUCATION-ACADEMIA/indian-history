<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Foreign invasions was the second major factor in the decline and disappearance of the Gutpas. The invasion of barbaric tribe Pushyamitra was not the decisive. A far more important invasion was that of the White Huns, who, after settling in the Oxus vally, invaded India.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Huna people, well known as Huns, attacked Gupta territory and damaged the empire hugely. This era declined in almost 550 CE when it was divided into regional states after inventions from north, west, and east. There were huge dissensions and conflicts among the royal families due to which the rule became weak.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-So weak rulers along with incessant invasions from foreign as well as native rulers caused the decline of the Gupta Empire. By the beginning of the sixth century, the empire had disintegrated and was ruled by many regional chieftains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There was a racial admixture in India after the Huna invasion and this was one of the most significant effects. Various tribes entered India through North West, same as the central Asian tribes, some of whom remained in Northern India and some moved further to the south and the west.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Gupta king who had to face the first Huna invasion was Kumaragupta I. His reign lasted for 40 years between CE 415 – 455 and was one of the last great emperors of the Gupta Dynasty. He was successful in defeating the Huns and performed the Ashvamedha to celebrate his victory.
